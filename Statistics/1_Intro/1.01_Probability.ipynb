    "\n",
    "This crash course will emphasize conceptual understanding. I strongly dislike the common \"learning technique\"  of memorizing then plug and chug. I believe understanding things conceptually and seeing where they come from provides a more fundamental understanding of the subject than  memorizing definitions, equations, and question style. The fundamental understanding helps with applying the learned material to real world senerios and not just carefully constructed problem sets.\n",
