It can also be interpreted as modeling the quantile of the distribution. The main difference is the cdf of a continuous distribution is a continuous function while the cdf of a discrete distribution is a stepwise function."

    "A continuous random variable's pdf and a discrete random variable's pmf both models probability, however they do it in different ways. A pmf models probability directly, while a pdf models probability indirectly. The pdf models the probability density (hence the name) and the probability is the area under the curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability density is analogous to density in physics. In physics, density is how much \"stuff\" is in a given unit volume. Objects with higher density has a higher mass, assuming they have the same volume. Probability density is how much probability is in a given unit interval. And values with a higher probability density is relatively more \"likely\" to occur, even though the absolute probability is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the mass of object is constrain to be between $0$g and $1$g. The density an object is not constrain to be between $0$ and $1$. The object could have a high density (like $2$g), but have a low volume (like .1cm). Similarly, probability density could be greater than 1 even though probability is constrained to be between $[0,1]$."
