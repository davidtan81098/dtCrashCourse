    "There are times where one random variable $Y$ will be defined as a function of another random variable $X$. If know the distribution of $X$ and not $Y$, we would need to calculate the distribution $Y$. For the rest of the chapter, suppose we have a random variable $X$, and random variable $Y$ where $Y=g(X)$ and $X=g^{-1}(Y)$. Since function $g$ is invertible, then $g$ is also monotonic (the derivative is always $\\le 0$ or $\\ge0$)."

    "Imagine the event $X=x$ and event $Y=y$ are the results for the same set of outcomes $A$ and the sample space of all the outcomes is $S$. That means both $P(X=x)$ and $P(Y=y)$ both equal to $\\frac{|A|}{|S|}$, therefore they have the same probability. We know that the 2 random variables are related, $Y=g(X)$. That means result of one random variables can be rewritten in terms of the the other, $y=g(x)$ and $x = g^{-1}(y)$. We can intrept equation 1 as the probability at $x$ got \"moved\" to $g(x)$. Do this for a all values of $x$ and we will get the pmf of $Y$."
